# Commodify

## Introduction

Commodify is an app to visualize and interact with commodity market and weather data.

### The problem

Existing resources deal mostly with individual sectors like energy or agriculture, but not the the whole commodities space, and they are read only. In order to get an overview of the entire market, one needs to manually integrate data from many different resources, which is time intensive and technically difficult for most traders.

### The solution

Commodify provides a "one-stop-shop" for commodities and weather data, which can be a useful resource for trade houses, banks and hedge funds.

Commodify allows for seeing not only trends in the commodities markets, but also the interaction between weather and climate and prices, which are crucial determinants of commodity supply and demand. The app is divided into two pages, a "Dashboard" and a "Search" page.

The dashboard page gives the user a global overview of the commodities market, and also allows them to drill down into more specific markets and sectors.

The search page allows the user to select a commodity sector, for example 'grains', or 'petroleum'. After selecting one of these options the user will be presented with the option to search for country or state level data, and will then be shown drop-down menus for the data available. 

For example, these might be one drop-down menu for states, one for commodity attributes (e.g. acreage or yield), and one for the period to be selected. The will also be the option to add weather data to the search, so for example the user might request to see annual average temperatures for the selected states. Once the 'Search' button is pressed, the user will see the requested data in tabular form.
